# Library-Management-Automation-OOC


I am learning object oriented concepts using Java.
In this project, I will follow the codes of an existing project by another person to get acquainted with basic object oriented ideas.

The link of that repository follows: 

https://github.com/busebozkurtt/Library-Management-System

This project is not assigned by anyone and learing is the primary objective. 
Thus the codes are not quite original.
